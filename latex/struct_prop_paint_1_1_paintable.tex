A \doxylink{struct_prop_paint_1_1_paintable}{Paintable} is the definition of a collection of one or more Mesh Renderers and the way that that Mesh Renderer can be "{}painted"{}, i.\+e., have its material changed. For instance, it could be of type WALL, which would only allow wallpaper, or type FURNITURE, which could be used to paint -\/ for example -\/ the seat of a chair.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A \doxylink{struct_prop_paint_1_1_paintable}{Paintable} is the definition of a collection of one or more Mesh Renderers and the way that that Mesh Renderer can be "{}painted"{}, i.\+e., have its material changed. For instance, it could be of type WALL, which would only allow wallpaper, or type FURNITURE, which could be used to paint -\/ for example -\/ the seat of a chair. 

One \doxylink{class_prop}{Prop} can have many Paintables.
